- 2026-05-13T06:50:00Z bootstrap firm-bus created by ai-1 (initial setup commit)
- 2026-05-13T07:02:19Z firm.sh launched (8 tabs)
- 2026-05-13T07:23:18Z ai-1 note: firm launcher failed twice (1) heredoc→wt newline split→0x80070002, (2) single-quoted inner cmd→bash treats path as one word→exit 127. Both diagnosed + fixed; firm-wt-split.sh + firm-wt-tabs.sh now pass UNQUOTED inner cmd. See _runbooks/firm-launcher.md and 00-claude-inbox/nexus/2026-05-13_firm-launch-failure-diagnosis-2.md.
